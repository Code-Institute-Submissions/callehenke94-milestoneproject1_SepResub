# PlaygroundTV

This is a mock up for a safe streaming service for kids. It provides youngsters with fun and learning content while making sure they are safe and not being exposed to adult content, violence or extracting any form of data and information from them.
The service is monetized via ads, with the option to subscribe to remove said ads and gain added features like downloadable content. 

It can be added upon and expanded in the future, including dynamic data gathering and more content in general. 

## UX and features

Design is focused on being kidfriendly and playful. Trying to minimize text based information and make every image clickable as to facilitate greater interaction with the content. 
Divided up the different categories using "channels" as to more easily let the user find non-verbal content for example. 
Trying to minimize distance from "click to watch" as much as possible, making it so we maximize the time a user spends watching videos. 

## Technology

Website is created using HTML and CSS, with many elements of Bootstrap included. 
Video Hosting service is provided by Brightcove.

## Testing and QA

Using Jigsaw W3C, I have some errors but those are due to old/missing dependencies and incompatabilities, not design or HTML functions.
